## COVID-19 Environmental Music Project: Bridging Tradition and Technology

This project explores the intersection of traditional Asian music and modern digital soundscapes, creating a unique musical composition that reflects on the environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It combines the organic sounds of a traditional Asian silk string instrument (zither) with digital beats, demonstrating the potential for collaboration and innovation in music production.

### Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the world, not only in terms of public health but also on our relationship with the environment. This music project serves as a reflection on this period, using music to evoke emotions and inspire thought about our connection to nature.  The composition blends the ancient sounds of the zither with contemporary digital music production techniques, creating a sonic experience that bridges tradition and technology.

### Technical Details

*   **Digital Audio Workstation (DAW):** FL Studio
*   **Sound Library:** Outlier
*   **Instrument:** Traditional Asian silk string instrument (zither)
*   **Musical Elements:** Pentatonic scales, nature-inspired sounds (clean water, air, plants, birds), sounds of traditional Asian iron tools.

### Inspiration

The project draws inspiration from:
