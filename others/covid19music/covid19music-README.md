## Acoustic-Digital System Integration: The Environmental Soundscape Project

This project serves as a technical case study in system integration and cross-domain abstraction, combining the unique acoustic input of a traditional Asian silk string instrument (zither) with a fully digital audio production pipeline. The core objective was to achieve high-fidelity cohesion and synthesis between organic, analog sound sources and modern electronic production.

### Technical Pipeline & Methodology

* Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) / Development Environment: FL Studio
* Instrument/Input: Traditional Asian silk string instrument (Zither)
* Sound Design & Synthesis: Utilized the Outlier library and advanced sound design techniques within the DAW to generate distinct digital elements (beats, nature-inspired sounds, traditional tool textures).
* Algorithmic Composition: Implemented structured musical logic using pentatonic scales and defined tempos as the foundational code for the composition's rhythm and harmony.

### Abstraction and System Integration

The project demonstrates:

*   **System Coherence**: Successfully bridging an acoustic, high-latency input (zither) with a precise, low-latency digital beat environment.
*   **Creative Problem Solving**: Applying traditional musical theory (compositional structure, rhythm) to define and execute the parameters of a digital production environment.
*   **Technical Expertise**: Proficient use of a professional DAW for beat creation, sound design, and complex signal manipulation.

This work directly translates to my technical practice by showcasing mastery in designing logical frameworks, handling complex data types (acoustic signals vs. digital synthesis), and resolving integration conflicts across different systems.
