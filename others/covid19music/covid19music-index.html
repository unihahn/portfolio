  <p>This composition, exploring themes of hope and healing, was produced using FL Studio and Outlier libraries.</p>

<p>My music production experience has developed key skills, including software proficiency, meticulous attention to detail, and effective project management.  These skills are complemented by a strong appreciation for human connection and the natural world, which informs my creative process.</p>
