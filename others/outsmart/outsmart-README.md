## Outsmart Your Brain Book Review

This project, developed for the American Language Program at Columbia University, demonstrates my proficiency in Google Workspace (Slides, Sheets, and Docs). I created a learning tool and presentation based on "Outsmart Your Brain" by Daniel T. Willingham, showcasing my data organization, analysis, and communication skills.  I also incorporated comparisons with "Fifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy" by Tim Harford, exploring their combined insights on enhancing academic performance for college students.

### Project Overview

I:

* Read and analyzed "Outsmart Your Brain," identifying key themes and insights.  I further explored the topic by comparing Willingham's work with "Fifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy" by Tim Harford, focusing on their relevance to academic performance in college.
* Created a Google Sheet learning tool to organize information, quotes, and chapter summaries.
* Developed a Google Slides presentation summarizing the review and highlighting productive learning methods, including time management, memorization techniques, procrastination strategies, and exam preparation.
