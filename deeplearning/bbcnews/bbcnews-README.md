## BBC News Summarization LLM

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop an application that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to summarize BBC News articles. Currently, it's in the initial development phase.

### Current Status

* **Goal:** To create a Python application that can automatically summarize BBC News articles.
* **Technology:** Using the LLM API/Framework Hugging Face Transformers.
* **Next Steps:**
    * Gather BBC News article data.
    * Implement basic summarization functionality using the chosen LLM.
    * Explore techniques for improving summarization accuracy (e.g., RAG).

### Planned Features

* Automatic summarization of BBC News articles.
* Implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
* Potential for user-specified summary length or focus.

### Getting Started

* This is an ongoing project. Code and instructions will be added as development progresses.
