## TherapistBot (In Development)

TherapistBot is a mobile application under development using MIT App Inventor. This project is a vastly simplified version of a famous program called ELIZA that was developed at MIT in the early 1960s by Professor Joseph Weizenbaum. It is inspired by ELIZA's approach to natural language interaction, though TherapistBot focuses on providing mental health support resources.  This project is in its early stages and aims to provide users with accessible and convenient mental health support and resources. It explores the potential of no-code development platforms for creating helpful applications in the mental health domain. The app's design is based on core principles of active listening and therapeutic questioning.

### Features (Current)

* **"I" to "You" Reflection:** The app includes a feature that reflects the user's statements back to them, replacing "I" pronouns with "You." This technique, central to active listening, helps users externalize their feelings and gain a different perspective. The algorithm detects instances of "I" (case-insensitive) in the user's input and replaces them with "You" before displaying the response.
* **Therapeutic Hedges:** To create a more realistic and supportive interaction, the bot also utilizes a set of therapeutic "hedges." These are phrases like "tell me more," "it's common to feel this way," or "many of my patients say the same thing" that are used to encourage the user to elaborate on their feelings and normalize their experiences. These hedges are triggered randomly or based on certain keywords in the user's input.

### Features (Planned)

* **Guided Meditation Exercises:** (This is planned for a future release.) Offers a variety of guided meditation scripts to help users relax, de-stress, and improve their mental well-being.
* **Mental Health Resources Directory:** (Planned) Provides a curated list of mental health professionals, support organizations, and online resources.
* **Interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Exercises:** (Planned) Includes interactive exercises based on CBT techniques.
* **Personalized User Profiles:** (Planned) Allows users to create profiles to track their progress.
* **More sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) for better understanding of user input.**

### Technologies Used

* MIT App Inventor (Primary Development Platform)
* (Mention any other technologies, libraries, or APIs you used or plan to use.)

### Development Process

TherapistBot is being developed using MIT App Inventor's visual programming interface. The project involves:

* **Conceptualization and Design:** Defining the app's purpose, target audience, and key features, with a focus on active listening principles.
* **UI/UX Design:** Creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
* **Implementation (Current):** Building the app's core functionality, including the "I" to "You" transformation and therapeutic hedges.
* **Implementation (Planned):** Expanding the app with guided meditations, resource directory, CBT exercises, etc.
* **Testing and Debugging:** Ongoing testing and debugging.

### Future Enhancements

* Integration with mental health APIs.
* Expansion of CBT exercises and resources.
* Continued improvement of NLP capabilities.

### Project Motivation

This project was inspired by the need for increased access to mental health support. It demonstrates the feasibility of creating helpful mental health applications using no-code platforms, emphasizing techniques like active listening and therapeutic questioning. This is an ongoing project with plans for significant expansion.
