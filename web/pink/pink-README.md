## Welcome to Disneyland!

This is a simple HTML webpage introducing Disneyland and featuring a table.

### Project Overview

This webpage provides a brief welcome message to Disneyland, includes a link to Google, displays a picture (presumably of Barbie), and provides contact information. It also includes a bonus table demonstrating HTML table structure and styling with CSS.

### Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS (for table styling)

### How to View the Project

1.  Save the provided HTML code as an `index.html` file.
2.  Ensure the image file (named `images.jpeg` in the code) is placed in the same directory as the `index.html` file, or adjust the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag to the correct path.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

### Content

The webpage contains the following elements:

*   A heading welcoming visitors to Disneyland.
*   A welcome message introducing "Barbie."
*   A link to Google.
*   An image (the source file should be provided and named `images.jpeg`).
*   Contact information, including an email link and a link to Disney World's website.
*   A table demonstrating HTML table structure and styled with CSS. The table's first row has a yellow background, and the other rows have a light pink background.

### Image Source

The image source file (`images.jpeg`) should be placed in the same directory as the HTML file.  If the image is not present, the image element will not display anything.
