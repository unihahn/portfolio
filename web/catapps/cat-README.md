## CatPhotoApp

This project is a simple HTML webpage called CatPhotoApp, created as a practice project for learning HTML. It displays information about cats, including photos, lists of things cats love and hate, and a form for submitting cat photos.

### Project Overview

The CatPhotoApp webpage is designed to be a fun and interactive introduction to HTML. It demonstrates the use of various HTML elements, including:

*   Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)
*   Paragraphs (`<p>`)
*   Links (`<a>`)
*   Images (`<img>`)
*   Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
*   Figures and Captions (`<figure>`, `<figcaption>`)
*   Forms (`<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<button>`)
*   Semantic elements (`<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`)

The page includes links to external resources (freeCodeCamp and a cat photo URL), displays cat photos, lists things cats love and hate, and provides a form where users can submit a cat photo URL and specify whether their cat is indoor or outdoor, and its personality.
